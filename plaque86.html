Born in Aberdeen  and educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Marischal College, Simpson became a master of the Gothic and Classical styles of architecture, working in brick and granite in both public and domestic architecture. He designed the Athenaeum building in Castlegate, as well as Bon-Accord Crescent.</p><p id="more_info_1">The stone upon which the memorial to Archibald Simpson  is carved was originally one of four granite pieces which were intended to be carved into heraldic lions for the George VI Bridge. The Second World war halted work on the bridge, which eventually opened without the lions. One of the blocks was given to the Aberdeen Civic Society in 1975, which became the memorial to Archibald Simpson in Bon Accord Square. The remaining three were erected as 'Nascent Lions' in Hazlehead Park.</p></body></html>
