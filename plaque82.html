The archway was erected in 1637 by Andrew Thomson, Advocate and Sheriff-Depute in Aberdeen, as the gateway to his house in Guestrow. His initials and those of his wife, Agnes Divie, are on the panel built into this wall. On demolition of the properties in the Guestrow, in 1931, the archway was rebuilt in Union Terrace Gardens, from where it was taken in 1970 and re-erected here.</p></body></html>
