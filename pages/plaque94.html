Little is known about the chapel save that David II ordered its completion in 1368. It seems to have gone out of use at the Reformation, although this is far from certain. However in 1649 the Kirk Session of St Machar's found it necessary to prohibit people from burying their relatives in the churchyard. Through the remainder of the century and into the eighteenth century people flocked to the well in May when it was believed that the miraculous water was good for cleansing and cleaning of sores.

The stones in the graveyard date from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p></body></html>
