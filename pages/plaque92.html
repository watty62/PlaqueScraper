The lands of Pitmuxton were granted by Robert the Bruce to Hugo of Aberdeen in 1309</p><p id="more_info_1">In 1309 Robert the Bruce gifted the lands of Pitmuxton to one Hugo of Aberdeen. This grant or gift carried with it the hereditary office of Mair of Fee. The charter is now lost but was listed amongst the lost charters of Robert the Bruce in the nineteenth century -  see Collections for a History of the Shires of Aberdeen and Banff, p.232. 

The place name, Pitmuxton, probably derives from Gaelic origins and means something like place of the pigs. The lands eventually passed to a descendant of the Keith family, and then in the 1400s they passed to Robert Blinseil, one time Provost of Aberdeen.

Blinseil granted an annual rent of two marks from the lands of Pitmuxton to the altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary in order to celebrate an obit for himself and his wife, Isabella Wood, on the anniversary of their deaths. The money was also to be used for buying bread and meat for thirteen poor people.

In 1647 a woman from Brechin, who was infected by the plague, settled in Pitmuxton and from here this visitation of the plague spread and claimed just under 2000 lives. On Parson Gordons map of Aberdeen in 1661 in the small section entitled Agor Aberdonensis Pitmuckstoun is shown as a small town with a mill.

In 1668 the lands passed to the family of Skene of Ruthrieston. They retained these lands until 1770. According to Fenton Wyness in Spots from the Leopard it was probably the Skene family who built the version of Pitmuxton house which survived until 1908. Wyness notes that the house faced south east and that it had a tree lined avenue. 

The next owner of the house was George Allan (whose connection is remembered in the adjacent Allan Street). It was probably during the time that the property was in the possession of the Allan family that the name was changed from Pitmuxton house to the slightly more salubrious Pitstruan House, which derives from the Gaelic for place of the burn. In 1908 the house was demolished.  Wyness notes that the well of the house was extant in No.39 Salisbury Terrace for many years afterwards. The site of the house is now occupied by Ruthrieston Outdoor Centre.</p></body></html>
