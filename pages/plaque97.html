21 and his mother's family had moved from Southern Italy when she was three. He was born on 14 December 1917 at 35 Causewayend (now demolished). He was born in the family house, above his father's shop and cafe. He was his parent's first child. A second son, Valentino, was born some nine years later, at the same address, on 29 April 1926. 

It is from the shop that Alberto's technically incorrect surname derives. The name on Alberto's birth certificate, and indeed the correct family name is Marrocco. The story goes that the sign-writer who painted the sign for Alberto's father's shop had not heard the name correctly and hence misspelled it as Morrocco. Despite this mistake Alberto assumed the incorrect version of the name. Indeed Alberto thought for many years that his correct name was Morrocco and the mistake was only brought to his attention when he applied for a passport. 

He attended Sunnybank School and Causewayend School before being accepted, at age 14, into Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen. He attended Gray's between 1932 and 1938. At Gray's he was taught by James Cowie whose fine draughtsmanship had an impact on the young Alberto and by Robert Sivell whose interest in the Italian Renaissance had a significant and lasting impact on Alberto and his work. After completing his studies in 1938 Morrocco and Sivell worked together on murals for the Students' Union of the University of Aberdeen. 

In 1939, Morrocco went abroad and studied in France and Switzerland, and after military service during World War II continued his painting while also working as an illustrator. In 1941, he married fellow painter Vera Mercer. They had three children</p></body></html>
