Soon after qualifying as a medical doctor Lawrence was diagnosed with diabetes. At the time, in the early 20th century, a disease such as this was normally fatal. Having moved to Florence to spend his remaining time there he was called back to Britain by his friend G.Harrison at King's College Hospital, London, with the message 'I have got some insulin. It works. Come back quick.'

Lawrence quickly learned how to manage diabetes and became a leading specialist in the field. His books, The Diabetic Life and The Diabetic ABC both ran to numerous editions. He and his close friends are credited with creation of the Diabetic Department at King's College Hospital, of which he subsequently became head. In 1934 with the public support of his friend and patient the novelist H.G.Wells he founded the Diabetic Association, now the British Diabetic Association. He was the Chairman of its executive council from 1934 to 1961. In 1950 he was involved in founding the International Diabetic Federation, of which body he was President until 1958.</p><p id="more_info_1">Robert, commonly known as Robin, Lawrence was born in Aberdeen on 18 November 1892. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Aberdeen University. He followed his elder brother into medical school and graduating with honours in 1916. He then joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the next three years in India.

Returning home in 1919, he obtained an appointment as second House Surgeon in the Casualty Department of King's College Hospital, London, later transferring to the Ear, Nose and Throat Department. It was here that he was first diagnosed with diabetes. At the time a diagnosis such as this was in effect a death sentence. People so diagnosed could get neither jobs or life insurance. He left for Florence to practise medicine amongst the ex-pat community there and to live the remainder of what he believed would be a short life in beautiful surroundings. 

At the time there were a number of quack cures being circulated for diabetes</p></body></html>
