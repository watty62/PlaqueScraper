The land upon which the street was formed had previously been croft land owned by different people and groups. The street has had a number of names over the centuries including Aedies Wynd and Westerkirkgate. Originally the street ran alongside St Nicholas Church down to the Green area of Aberdeen. When Union Street was laid out the section of Back Wynd connecting the street to the Green was severed. However a set of stairs on the south side of Union Street carry down to the Green and are known as Back Wynd steps.</p><p id="more_info_1">As a street Back Wynd dates from 1590-1594. However the land upon which the street was laid out in the 1590s does have a longer recorded history. It was part of a croft of land known as the Sow Croft and later as Caberstone Croft</p></body></html>
