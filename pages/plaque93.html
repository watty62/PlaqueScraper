The Poor Sisters of Nazareth arose out of the ongoing need to provide care for the elderly and poor. At the instigation of Cardinal Wiseman, Archbishop of Westminster, a number of Little Sisters of the Poor were released from their order and moved from France to London on 10 April 1851. In Hammersmith a foundation was made and owing to the recall of a number of the sisters to France a young novice of 14 weeks standing, Victoire Larmenier (later Mother St Basil) became the superior of the community. Larmenier (born July 1827 and died June 1878) was born in Brittany, the daughter of a timber merchant. In February 1851 she entered the group known then as Pious Women and later as the Little Sisters of the Poor. A month later, in March, she received the religious habit and after a further five months found herself in Hammersmith. 

It was not until 1864 that the community was recognised by the Papacy as a distinct religious institution and took the title Congregation of the Poor Sisters of Nazareth. On 14 February 1862 Mother St Basil and six sisters arrived in Aberdeen (thus sometime before they were officially the Poor Sisters of Nazareth) and made what is seen to be their second foundation. They moved into 2 houses in Chapel Court next to the then unused St Peters Church. At that time Mass was again said in St Peters for the Sisters. The church had been closed for repairs in 1860 when St Marys was opened. The Poor Sisters of Nazareth remained in Chapel Court until 10 December 1872 when they moved to a newly built Nazareth House on Claremont Street.</p></body></html>
