At the time the sugar business was highly lucrative and growing in importance</p><p id="more_info_1">Sugar production in the 18th century saw an exponential growth as European tastes changed and the price of sugar came down so that it was no longer a luxury good for the very rich only. Demand for sugar remained extremely high and it was often valued as highly as gold or pearls. The British Empire was heavily involved in sugar production most of which took place in colonies in the New World, generally involving vast numbers of slave labourers imported specifically to work on the sugar plantations. Indeed for centuries the sugar trade was intimately bound up with the slave trade. Sugar was grown in the plantations of the colonies and then sometimes processed there or sent abroad for processing before sale to the public. 

In the middle of the 18th century the process of sugar refining began to spread in Scotland. Glasgow, Greenock and Dundee, along with Aberdeen ventured into this manufacturing process. Trade was principally between the plantations in the southern states of the USA and the West Indies. The first sugarhouse in Aberdeen was set up by John Moir of Stoneywood on his own estate; Moir is principally remembered as a senior Jacobite in Aberdeen during the 1745-6 Rebellion. 

The second enterprise in Aberdeen sought to locally refine the sugar for forward sale to the public in the north east of Scotland. On 8 May 1776 a sasine was granted of a plot of lands at the shore in order to erect a sugar refining business. The sasine was granted to Baillie William Young, James Burnett of Countesswells, John Burnett, Thomas Bannerman, Alexander Garioch and Alexander Young, all merchants in Aberdeen. They had formed a contract for 'carrying on a Joint trade of Importing raw Sugars to Aberdeen and of boiling and manufacturing the Same'. The piece of land which they acquired was described thus</p></body></html>
