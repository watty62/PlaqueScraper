There had been a need for a bridge to replace the ferry boat system of crossing the river Dee at this position for some time. The final impetus came after the Dee Ferry Boat disaster of 5 April 1876, when 32 people lost their lives. The bridge was a response to this disaster and was partly funded by public contributions as well as by Aberdeen Council City Council.</p><p id="more_info_1">In the late 19th century both Aberdeen and Torry experienced rapid population growth and expansion. In Torry many new streets were created. Concomitant with this there was a growing need for a bridge to connect Torry to Aberdeen. Prior to the erection of this bridge pedestrians had some access by the Wellington Suspension Bridge but most carts and carriages would have had to cross the river some 2.6 k to the south on the medieval Bridge of Dee. The main means of access between Torry and Aberdeen in the 19th century was a ferry boat operated by means of a pulley system. This ferry boat had been in operation from medieval times and plied between Pocra Quay and Torry. 

Aside from the increase in numbers travelling between Torry and Aberdeen due to population growth and urban expansion, the Bay of Nigg in Torry was a popular destination for day holiday makers from Aberdeen. One day holidays in particular attracted large numbers of people to the Torry area. 5 April 1876 was a Sacramental feast day, and was thus a holiday for most people in Aberdeen. There was a fair at Torry and many people were crossing the Dee by ferry in order to get to it. 

People waiting at the Aberdeen side had become impatient waiting for the ferry to arrive. When it did they pushed onto the boat without allowing time for those already on board to vacate the ferry. Consequently the boat set off on its return journey over loaded with in excess of 70 people on board. The ferry started to shake mid stream, in a river that was already swollen and fast flowing, the rope was loosened and the boat drifted. As she capsized a  number of passengers were able to swim to safety but 32 people drowned, mostly those from Aberdeen. 

This disaster provided the final impetus to build a new bridge for heavy traffic and wheeled conveyances. Three plans were initially considered, one of an iron ribbed bridge by the Blaikie Brothers (at a cost of 17500); an iron lattice girder bridge by Abernethy (at a cost of 12000) and the plan which was finally approved, by Andrew Gibb (lithographer) for a granite bridge. Despite initial estimates that the bridge would cost some 19000 it eventually cost 25000 to erect, following some difficulties with the foundations. Twelve caissons (or footings) were sunk into the river bed to take the bridge's four piers which sit in the Dee. The caissons were supposed to be sunk to a depth of 27 foot but had to be sunk to 42 foot. The bridge consists of five arches of between 60 and 66 foot in width. It is 342 foot in length and 40 foot broad. 

The funding for the bridge came from a variety of different sources. The Aberdeen Land Association (which had been instrumental in developing Torry as a residential area) contributed 5700; Mr Davidson of Balnagask (a prominent landowner in the Torry area) gave 1000; the Harbour Commissioners contributed 1000; Mr Morrice of Tullos estate gave 200 whilst the balance of 17100 was met by Aberdeen City Council. This plaque was unveiled in February 2005 when children from Torry primary schools dressed as the victims of the Ferry Boat disaster processed over the bridge prior to an ecumenical service being held.</p></body></html>
