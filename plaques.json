Arguably public performances in Aberdeen can be traced back to the dramatic religious performances of the pre-reformation era. From the early 17th century James VI licensed stage plays and companies of comedians to perform in the city. From the latter 17 and early 18th century travelling theatre companies and theatre productions became almost unheard of in Scotland. After some opposition a company of comedians established themselves in Edinburgh in 1745 and a detachment in Aberdeen in 1751. The detachment were initially denied any premises in Aberdeen itself and raised a building on the south side of the Spittal for performances. This closed after one season. In 1768 the magistrates licensed a company under one Fisher to perform in Aberdeen, in the New Inn. In 1773 the celebrated West Digges attempted to establish a theatre in Aberdeen. Having been opposed he set up a successful theatre on the north side of the Spittal. \r\n\r\nIn the wake of this success a site was selected on the newly formed Marischal St to house a permanent theatre in Aberdeen proper. The building was completed in 1795 at a cost of \u00c2\u00a33000 raised by subscription. Eventually the site was purchased outright by John Fraser, a local merchant. The theatre was effectively small to medium sized housing some 5-600 people. In the first few decades of its existence it was particularly popular and drew in many of those from Aberdeen's high society. The journalist W.Carnie reminisced that in the 1830s 'I have seen Marischal Street half lined with the waiting carriages of the best families of the town and county.' Its main attraction, after 1818, was its production of Rob Roy. In 1817 the lease of the Theatre Royal had been taken on by Corbet Ryder, who was an actor-manager. He made a reputation for himself with his swashbuckling acting style. It has been argued that Ryder, and his wife Jessie Pollock (who managed the Theatre after her husband's death in 1842), established Scotland's northern theatre circuit using Aberdeen as their base. \r\n\r\nBy the 1830s and the 1840s the growing evangelical reform movement in Aberdeen successfully challenged the notion of the theatre as being a respectable form of entertainment for the aspirational and established classes. At this time the 'Penny Rattler' or Bool Road Theatre attracted more patrons and more criticism for its poor performances and violence and drunkenness that attended its performances. Aside from these considerations Pollock's tastes were conservative, at a time when London based shows were increasing available (via an improving transport network) to the north. This led to a need to build a big venue to attract these touring London shows, this led to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre and Opera House in 1872 (reopened as the Tivoli in 1910 after a refit by Frank Matcham), the Palace Theatre in 1898 and finally His Majesty's Theatre in 1906, His Majesty's could seat 2500.

However between the 12th and the 14th centuries Tolbooths generally also came to house the Burgh's courts (the Baillie, Head, and Guild Courts) as well as other official functions such as the Sheriff's Court. It is not known where the pre 1393 Tolbooth was located. An earlier version may have been sited at the waterfront, on the line of modern Virginia Street. After a charter issued by Robert III in 1393 a new Tolbooth was built approximately under where the Sheriff Court part of today's Town House sits. \r\n\r\nBetween 1616 and 1629 a Wardhouse Tower was built on to the east end of the Tolbooth. This was built by Thomas Watson, master mason of Old Rayne, following an order from James VI that all burghs should have \u00e2\u0080\u0098sure and sufficient' prisons. In this case the Wardhouse was to act as prison for both the Burgh and Shire of Aberdeen. The Tolbooth building continued to grow and develop over the next few centuries. \r\n\r\nIn the 19th century it was decided to demolish much of the old complex of buildings and erect a new Town House. The only exception was the Wardhouse Tower of the Tolbooth which was to be preserved. The architects hired were Peddie and Kinnear who designed a new Town House in sandstone to match the free stone (imported from Kingoodie in the 17th century) from which the Wardhouse Tower of the Tolbooth was made. However the City Council wanted a granite Town House and Peddie and Kinnear subsequently altered their designs. The Town and County Buildings which were erected were built between 1867 and 1874 in a Scottish baronial style. \r\n\r\nToday the Town House contains the Council Chambers (in a modern annex appended to the building in the 1970s), the Sheriff's Court and the Wardhouse Tower of the Tolbooth. The Wardhouse Tower is today known simply as the Tolbooth and houses Aberdeen's Museum of Civic History. The Museum retains a unique atmosphere and has displays in the various 17th and 18th century cells which survive. Displays include ones on crime and punishment and local history. The Museum is open seasonally over the summer months. This site has been used for civic governance in Aberdeen for some 7 centuries. The Town House main entrance on Castle Street leads into an impressive Victorian entrance hall which feature the town's mortification boards (records of bequests and gifts to the town over the centuries).

There had been a need for a bridge to replace the ferry boat system of crossing the river Dee at this position for some time. The final impetus came after the Dee Ferry Boat disaster of 5 April 1876, when 32 people lost their lives. The bridge was a response to this disaster and was partly funded by public contributions as well as by Aberdeen Council City Council.", "about": "\n\nIn the late 19th century both Aberdeen and Torry experienced rapid population growth and expansion. In Torry many new streets were created. Concomitant with this there was a growing need for a bridge to connect Torry to Aberdeen. Prior to the erection of this bridge pedestrians had some access by the Wellington Suspension Bridge but most carts and carriages would have had to cross the river some 2.6 k to the south on the medieval Bridge of Dee. The main means of access between Torry and Aberdeen in the 19th century was a ferry boat operated by means of a pulley system. This ferry boat had been in operation from medieval times and plied between Pocra Quay and Torry. \r\n\r\nAside from the increase in numbers travelling between Torry and Aberdeen due to population growth and urban expansion, the Bay of Nigg in Torry was a popular destination for day holiday makers from Aberdeen. One day holidays in particular attracted large numbers of people to the Torry area. 5 April 1876 was a Sacramental feast day, and was thus a holiday for most people in Aberdeen. There was a fair at Torry and many people were crossing the Dee by ferry in order to get to it. \r\n\r\nPeople waiting at the Aberdeen side had become impatient waiting for the ferry to arrive. When it did they pushed onto the boat without allowing time for those already on board to vacate the ferry. Consequently the boat set off on its return journey over loaded with in excess of 70 people on board. The ferry started to shake mid stream, in a river that was already swollen and fast flowing, the rope was loosened and the boat drifted. As she capsized a  number of passengers were able to swim to safety but 32 people drowned, mostly those from Aberdeen. \r\n\r\nThis disaster provided the final impetus to build a new bridge for heavy traffic and wheeled conveyances. Three plans were initially considered, one of an iron ribbed bridge by the Blaikie Brothers (at a cost of \u00c2\u00a317500); an iron lattice girder bridge by Abernethy (at a cost of \u00c2\u00a312000) and the plan which was finally approved, by Andrew Gibb (lithographer) for a granite bridge. Despite initial estimates that the bridge would cost some \u00c2\u00a319000 it eventually cost \u00c2\u00a325000 to erect, following some difficulties with the foundations. Twelve caissons (or footings) were sunk into the river bed to take the bridge's four piers which sit in the Dee. The caissons were supposed to be sunk to a depth of 27 foot but had to be sunk to 42 foot. The bridge consists of five arches of between 60 and 66 foot in width. It is 342 foot in length and 40 foot broad. \r\n\r\nThe funding for the bridge came from a variety of different sources. The Aberdeen Land Association (which had been instrumental in developing Torry as a residential area) contributed \u00c2\u00a35700; Mr Davidson of Balnagask (a prominent landowner in the Torry area) gave \u00c2\u00a31000; the Harbour Commissioners contributed \u00c2\u00a31000; Mr Morrice of Tullos estate gave \u00c2\u00a3200 whilst the balance of \u00c2\u00a317100 was met by Aberdeen City Council. This plaque was unveiled in February 2005 when children from Torry primary schools dressed as the victims of the Ferry Boat disaster processed over the bridge prior to an ecumenical service being held.\n\n"}, {"name": "William Meff (1861 - 1935)", "location": "40 Fonthill Road", "area": "Central Aberdeen", "type": "Lord Provost of Aberdeen.

He was a founding member in 1885 of Aberdeen Artists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Society. In 1893 he was elected to the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolours (RSW) and at one time served as a member of the Hanging Committee. Gowans was active in the Northern Arts Club, serving as its Vice President in 1910-12.  His marriage to Jessie Ann Reid in 1886 was officiated by H.W. Wright, Minister of Ferryhill, and the couple lived first at 267 Union Street, then at 36 Holburn Street, and finally at 119 Broomhill Road.  Gowans is remembered mainly as a landscape artist of North East Scotland although his work covers many areas of Scotland, England and northern France, particularly Normandy and Picardy.

A sister, Maria, was born in 1845 but died shortly thereafter.  A younger brother, Samuel Frederick Ritchie Gowans, was born in 1847 and later served in the merchant marine, sailing clipper ships to China.  His father, George Gowans, was a veteran of the 93rd Regiment of Foot and served in Ireland, the West Indies, England, Canada and Scotland (including Aberdeen) between 1820-1841, before settling in Woodside where he worked at the mills as a weaver.  Gowans senior met and married his mother, Mary Taylor, while stationed at Fort Pitt, Chatham, where Mary's father had served with the 11th Light Dragoons during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nGowans lived with his father, mother, maternal aunt and younger brother in Woodside until the early 1850s, when the family moved to St. Pauls Street.  Following the death of his mother in 1856, the family lived at 36 Castle Street and at 70 Loch Street. By the age of 13, Gowans was studying art at the Mechanics Institution, winning a prize in the first (elementary) grade in 1857.  He won a free studentship in 1871 as a result of work submitted to the National competition, and he was awarded the silver medal in the National competition in 1879, the year he successfully passed all the examinations in the first group of subjects for a third grade, or Art Master's certificate. \n\nGowans studied in Aberdeen, London, and Paris at the Academie Julian under Bougereau and at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, including artistic anatomy with Matthias Duval.  He achieved success as a working artist and art instructor from the start.  He painted both in oil and watercolour as well as in pastels, pencil, and ink.  Although noted for his landscapes, he also produced portraits of family, friends, colleagues, and local notables.  His paintings featured regularly in the Royal Scottish Academy's summer exhibitions, as well as at those of the Royal Glasgow Institute, the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour and the Aberdeen Artists' Society.  He also exhibited at the Royal Academy in London and in the major London galleries.  One of his watercolours, the Muir of Dinnet now at the Aberdeen Art Gallery, was exhibited at both the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition in London and at the 1911 International Exhibition in Rome.\n\nAside from his painting and etching he had an active life in his younger years. He was an enthusiastic member of the Old Volunteers, and he was an active climber and an expert in fencing.

It works. Come back quick.'\n\nLawrence quickly learned how to manage diabetes and became a leading specialist in the field. His books, The Diabetic Life and The Diabetic ABC both ran to numerous editions. He and his close friends are credited with creation of the Diabetic Department at King's College Hospital, of which he subsequently became head. In 1934 with the public support of his friend and patient the novelist H.G.Wells he founded the Diabetic Association, now the British Diabetic Association.

At the time the sugar business was highly lucrative and growing in importance", "about": "\n\nSugar production in the 18th century saw an exponential growth as European tastes changed and the price of sugar came down so that it was no longer a luxury good for the very rich only. Demand for sugar remained extremely high and it was often valued as highly as gold or pearls. The British Empire was heavily involved in sugar production most of which took place in colonies in the New World, generally involving vast numbers of slave labourers imported specifically to work on the sugar plantations. Indeed for centuries the sugar trade was intimately bound up with the slave trade. Sugar was grown in the plantations of the colonies and then sometimes processed there or sent abroad for processing before sale to the public. \n\nIn the middle of the 18th century the process of sugar refining began to spread in Scotland. Glasgow, Greenock and Dundee, along with Aberdeen ventured into this manufacturing process. Trade was principally between the plantations in the southern states of the USA and the West Indies. The first sugarhouse in Aberdeen was set up by John Moir of Stoneywood on his own estate; Moir is principally remembered as a senior Jacobite in Aberdeen during the 1745-6 Rebellion. \n\nThe second enterprise in Aberdeen sought to locally refine the sugar for forward sale to the public in the north east of Scotland. On 8 May 1776 a sasine was granted of a plot of lands at the shore in order to erect a sugar refining business. The sasine was granted to Baillie William Young, James Burnett of Countesswells, John Burnett, Thomas Bannerman, Alexander Garioch and Alexander Young, all merchants in Aberdeen. They had formed a contract for 'carrying on a Joint trade of Importing raw Sugars to Aberdeen and of boiling and manufacturing the Same\u00e2\u0080\u00a6'.
