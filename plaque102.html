His father was a minister, William Mercer and his mother was Anna Monro. Hugh studied medicine at Marchical College for four years between 1740 and 1744. His father's sympathies lay with the British government and the Hanoverian monarchy but Hugh's lay with the Jacobites. He enlisted in Bonnie Prince Charlie's army as a surgeon's mate and was present at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. 

He eluded capture afterwards and made his way to America at some point between 1746 and 1747. He settled at the frontier settlement, Conococheague, near what is now Mercerburg Pennsylvania. In about 1755 he enrolled as a soldier and took part in the wars against the French and the American Indians. He took part in the failed expedition against Fort Du Quesne, under General Edward Braddock. On 9 July 1756 he was wounded at Monogahela, and later received a medal from the corporation of Philadelphia. In 1758 he became a Lieutenant-Colonel of the Provincials and was involved in negotiations with the Six Nation Amerindians in 1759. During this period he became friends with George Washington. 

After the war he moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia and restarted his career in medicine. There his friendship with Washington developed; they were members of the same Masonic Lodge. During this period he married Isabella Gordon, with whom he had four sons and one daughter. In 1775 he was a member of the Fredericksburg Committee of Safety and was increasingly concerned by the direction of British governance of the American colonies. This is shown in that he was one of the members of the Independent Company of the Town of Fredericksburg who on 25 April 1775 sent a letter of concern to Washington about George III's removal of gunpowder from the magazine at Williamsburg. 

As war broke out with Britain Mercer was keen to be involved on the revolutionary side; although he was at first denied a leadership position as he was a 'northern Briton'. He was subsequently elected Colonel of the Minute Men of Spotsylvania, King George, Stafford and Caroline Counties. On 11 January 1776 he was appointed Colonel to what would become the 3rd Virginia Regiment of the Continental Army, whilst in 1776 at Washington's recommendation he was appointed Brigadier-General in the Armies of the United Colonies. He accompanied Washington in his retreat through New Jersey, a retreat subsequently known as the 'crisis of the Revolution'. On 26 December 1776 he executed the successful attack against Hessian troops at Trenton. He later advised a night march on Princeton</p></body></html>
