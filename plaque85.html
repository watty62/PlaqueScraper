To mark the site of the Religious House of the Knights Templars and of the Knights of the Hospital of St.John of Jerusalem.
"Pro Utilitate Hominum"</p><p id="area">Rear Wall of exterior of St Peter's Churchyard</p><p id="about">Non-standard / Memorial</p><p id="more_info_1">This commemorates the site of a religious house of the Knights Templars and of the Knights of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem. Unfortunately there does not seem to be any evidence to substantiate the claims made on this plaque, although the Knights Templars did hold land in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.</p></body></html>
