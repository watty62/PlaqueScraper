Born in 1845 in Glasgow and brought up in Aberdeen</p><p id="more_info_1">Meredith Jemima Brown was born in 1845, although the New Dictionary of National Biography gives 1846 as a possible date, in Glasgow. Her parents moved to Aberdeen and she was brought up in Aberdeen. Her father was the Reverend David Brown, a Free Church minister, and one of those involved in revising the New Testament. Her mother was Catherine Dyce, sister of the famous artist, William Dyce. 

In the 1880s after her mother died Meredith moved to London. It was here that she became interested in the lives being led by impoverished factory girls in the East End. She realised that those girls working in similar factories in the West End led comparable lives and set out to effect some improvements. Initially this was done by setting up a place where these girls could meet in their spare time. She and a friend disguised themselves as factory girls in order to learn more about the lives being led by girls living in slums in the West End. Their experiences formed the basis for a book, Only a Factory Girl, the sales of which provided some 2000. Meredith used this money to purchase a house at 16 Union Street, Lisson Grove. This was the first incarnation of the Shaftesbury Institute. This provided not only cheap bed and breakfast accommodation for women coming to London but also a crche, and a place where women and girls could spend a safe, and teetotal, night. 

Meredith's work began to extend beyond the Institute</p></body></html>
