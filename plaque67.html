<htmL><body><p id="name">Blockhouse (1497 - 1832)</p><p id="location">Pocra Quay</p><p id="area">North Aberdeen</p><p id="about">This commemorates the blockhouse which was Aberdeens first harbour defence battery. A round lime and mortar building with several cannons, it was located strategically at the entry to the harbour and served as the first line of defence from a naval attack for several centuries. When a new battery was built in 1781 the blockhouse was leased out to various companies including the Greenland Whaling Company. The plaque states that a wooden fort stood on that spot in 1477, this has not been proven. The plaque finally states 1832 This Building Erected, this refers to a fish workers tenement, which was later demolished. 

This was erected by Dr Alexander Walker.</p></body></html>
